Hello! I am a data scientist based in Canada. I didn't start off in data science. It was a roundabout route starting with an MBA, followed by some roles as an analyst, and several years of self-taught statistics. Finally, I found myself in career that challenges me to constantly grow and learn. Currently, I create marketing mix models for different clients as part of my Data Science role at Cossette Media. This blog showcases my efforts in expanding the breadth and depth of my knowledge to sectors beyond my day-to-day living. Hope you enjoy!
